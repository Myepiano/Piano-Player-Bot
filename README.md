# Piano-Player-Bot



# Usage

A Discord bot that allows you to play notes on the piano by inputting commands into messages on Discord. Inputs can be specified by using the #play command followed by notes. An input example would be "#play C5 C5 G5 G5 A5 A5 G5", after which the bot will enter the voice channel that the user is currently in, and play these notes. In addition, note lengths can be specified by using a period after the note, including note values such as .quarter, .half, .whole, etc... Finally, the tempo can also be specified by seperating the note input with a comma, followed by tempo:<BPM speed>. A list of example pieces can be found by using the #help command.
